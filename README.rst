Django Offline Docs
=============================

What is it?
-----------------------------------------
Django is a very popular web framework for Python. One of the main strengths of Django is its excellent and extensive documentation (around 945 pages in Django 1.2). But Django does not provide pre-built HTML/PDF docs. Instead it asks you to build from source.

The purpose of this page is to provide you a convenient way to download and use the Django documentation offline.

This page provides Django docs in various formats (PDF and HTML in zip, tar.gz, 7z) for several versions of Django. Whenever a new version of Django is released, I will update this page.
